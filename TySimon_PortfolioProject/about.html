    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hi y'all! I'm Ty Simon, and I'm a game engineer based in the Nashville, Tennessee area! I love creating new and fun experiences with code!</p>

    <p>I'm currently studying for a Bachelor's in Game Engineering from the University of Silicon Valley, and I'm set to graduate in 2026.</p>

    <p>I am well-versed in the Unity and Unreal game engines. My favorite games to work on are third-person RPGs, but I love the opportunity to work on all types of games!</p>

    <p>I love game engineering because in an industry where everybody sticks to the same tried and true methods, I stay looking for new and innovative ways to play. I will always be willing to try something brand new!</p>

    <h3>In My Free Time</h3>
    <p>When I'm not coding or working on game projects, I like to play golf and listen to music. My favorite artists are Green Day, Tyler, The Creator, and Pantera. Music fuels my creativity and keeps me inspired!</p>
